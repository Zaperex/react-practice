<!-- Your job is to convert these static HTML files to React application, and make all the functions work.
If you have time, you can challenge your self to add some CSS to it to make it look better.
We will be using React Router to handle the routing, and Axios to handle the API calls. These are the two most important libraries in React, and you will be using them in the future.
You can use any other libraries you want
You can do online research to find out how to do it, but you should not copy and paste code from other websites. You should understand what you are doing, and write your own code.
We will have a project showcase session at the end of the onboarding, and you will be presenting your work to the team. So please make sure that you understand what you are doing.

Hope you enjoy this assignment, and hope you learn a lot through doing project!

Leo -->
