<h1>XXX's personal website</h1>

<h2>Hello! Welcome to XXX's home, please select your action:</h2>
<h3>1. my introduction</h3>
<h3>2. my contact</h3>
<!-- Last one should be highlighted to indicate that you are on this page -->
<h3>3. Send a message</h3>

<!-- Goal: Create a form and send the following information to the backend server. 
I have already created an API to handle everything in the backend for you.
API address: https://cloudsking.com/react_api.php
API method: POST
API parameters: name, phone_number, message
When API return the error message, you need to display the error message on the page.
When API return the success message, you need to display the success message on the page.
Use the React way to solve it. (Axios is recommended) -->

<!-- But Axios is not the way that we use in IEEE. Let's start from the easy step for this assignment.
In the future, we will learn how to use Redux Thunk to handle the API calls.
If you are interested, you are more than welcome to try to use Redux Thunk to handle the API calls to challenge yourself for now.
All web team directors and senior web asscotiates will be happy to help you if you have any questions. -->
